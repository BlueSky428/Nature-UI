# Contributing

Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Nature UI ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Nature UI:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</Kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/nature-ui/nature-ui))

2. Clone your fork locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/nature-ui.git

cd nature-ui
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `yarn prestart`. This
   command will install dependencies and bootstrap the repo using `lerna`

> If you run into any issues during this step, kindly reach out to the Nature UI
> React team here: <https://discord.gg/ZA7NgwkeQ4>

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Nature UI
uses a monorepo structure and we treat each component has an independent package
that can be consumed in isolation.

### Tooling

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage installation of dependencies and
  running various scripts. We also have yarn workspaces enabled by default.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and
  testing
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) for testing components and
  hooks
- [Nextjs](https://www.nextjs.org/) for a blazing fast documentation website.
  versioning and changelogs
- [Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) for changes
  documentation, changelog generation, and release management.

### Commands

**`yarn boot`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`yarn bootstrap`**: bootstraps the entire project and symlinks all
dependencies for cross-component development.

**`yarn storybook`**: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that
end with `.stories.tsx`.

**`yarn docs:start`**: run the documentation site locally.

**`yarn build`**: run build for all component packages.

**`yarn test`**: run test for all component packages.

**`yarn release`**: publish changed packages.

**`yarn pkg [package] <cmd>`**: Run a command on the specific package you're
working on. You can run `build`, `test`, `lint` commands.

#### Package Aliasing and Yarn Workspace

Since we're using lerna monorepo + yarn workspaces by default, this enables us
to run commands within component packages directly from the root.

Each component is named this way: `@nature-ui/[component]`. Let's say we want to
build the button component. Here's how to do it:

```bash
yarn workspace @nature-ui/button build

# or

lerna run build --scope @nature-ui/button
```

**Shortcut:** To make this shorter and more convenient, we've added an alias for
each component in the root `package.json`. Now you can simply do:

```bash
# to build
yarn pkg avatar build

# to test
yarn pkg avatar test
yarn pkg avatar test --watch

# to lint
yarn pkg avatar lint
```

This alias is particularly useful when you're working on a specific component
and want to avoid running the command for all components.

### Documentation

The documentation site is built with Next.js. If you'd like to contribute to the
docs, simply run `yarn build`, and `yarn docs:dev`

### Storybook

Build components in isolation with Storybook using `yarn storybook`

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

You may wish to use our starters to help you get going:

- `Create react app` JavaScript Starter:
  <https://codesandbox.io/s/nature-ui-0eolr>
- TypeScript Starter: <https://codesandbox.io/s/nature-uicra-typescript-0ii7c>

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features feature
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
<https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the nature-ui repository and clone your fork

2. Initialize `git flow` with `git flow init`
   <https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet>

3. Start a new `bugfix`, `feature`, `hotfix` etc with
   `git flow feature start <feature-name>`. This command will start a new
   feature branch name as `feature/<feature-name>` from develop branch.

4. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
   As you develop, you can run `yarn pkg <module> build` and
   `yarn pkg <module> test` to make sure everything works as expected. Please
   note that you might have to run `yarn boot` first in order to build all
   dependencies.

5. Run `yarn changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This
   will be used to generate a changelog when we publish an update.
   [Learn more about Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).
   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin master:master`
   (where origin will be your fork on GitHub) before `yarn changeset` works.

> If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc, you can run
> `yarn changeset add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document
> your changes.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

> **Dear Nature UI team:** Please do not merge code without tests
