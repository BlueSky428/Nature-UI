Nature UI is based on <a target='_blank' href='https://tailwindcss.com'>
tailwindcss</a> which means you can apply every tailwindcss configuration
pattern to which mostly requires a `tailwind.config.js` file and this is
mandatory.

A more basic `tailwind.config.js` file should look like:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

You will find a detailed guide on how to configure
