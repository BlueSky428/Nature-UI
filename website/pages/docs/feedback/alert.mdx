Alerts are used to communicate a state that affects a system, feature or page.

## Import

Nature UI exports 5 alert related components.

- `Alert`: A complete standalone alert component.
- `AlertWrapper`: The wrapper for alert components.
- `AlertIcon`: The visual icon for the alert that changes based on the `status`
  prop.
- `AlertTitle`: The title of the alert to be announced by screen readers.
- `AlertDescription`: The description of the alert to be announced by screen
  readers.

```js
import {
  Alert,
  AlertWrapper,
  AlertTitle,
  AlertDescription,
  AlertIcon,
} from '@nature-ui/core';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Alert status='error'>Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!</Alert>
```

## Advanced Usage

```jsx
<AlertWrapper variant='solid' status='error' className='rounded-md'>
  <AlertIcon />
  <AlertTitle className='mr-3'>Outdated</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>Your experience may be degraded!</AlertDescription>
</AlertWrapper>
```

### Status

Change the status of the alerts by passing the `status` prop. This affects the
color scheme and icon used. Alert supports `error`, `success`, `warning` and
`info` statuses.

```jsx
<Stack spacing='8px'>
  <Alert status='success'>Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!</Alert>
  <Alert status='error'>Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!</Alert>
  <Alert status='warning'>
    Seems your account is about expire, upgrade now
  </Alert>
  <Alert status='info'>Nature UI V2 is coming soon!</Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Variants

`Alert` has 4 variant styles you can use. Pass the `variant` prop and use either
`subtle`, `solid`, `left-accent` or `top-accent`.

```jsx
<Stack spacing='8px'>
  <Alert variant='subtle' status='success'>
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert variant='solid' status='success'>
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert variant='left-accent' status='success'>
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert variant='top-accent' status='success'>
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Composition

`Alert` ships with smaller components to allow for flexibility in creating all
kinds of layouts. Here's an example of a custom alert style and layout:

```jsx
<AlertWrapper
  status='success'
  variant='subtle'
  className='flex-col items-center justify-center text-center h-48'
>
  <AlertIcon boxSize='40px' className={'mr-0'} />
  <AlertTitle className='mt-4 mb-1 text-lg'>Application submitted!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription className='max-w-sm'>
